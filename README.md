# EventCal

This Sinatra app populates the database with upcoming concert events and allows users to add these events to their personal event pages, as well as, create/edit/delete new events. 

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run 'rake db:migrate', 'rake db:seed', and then run `shotgun`.
Everything should be set up.
